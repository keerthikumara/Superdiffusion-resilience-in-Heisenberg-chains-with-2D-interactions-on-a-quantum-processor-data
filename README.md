# Superdiffusion Resilience in Heisenberg Chains with 2D Interactions on a Quantum Processor — Data Repository

This repository contains the datasets and supporting scripts used in the manuscript  
**_“Superdiffusion Resilience in Heisenberg Chains with 2D Interactions on a Quantum Processor.”_**


## Repository Structure

- [`./scripts/`](./scripts/)  
  Contains the Python scripts used to construct and initialize the quantum circuits employed in both classical and hardware simulations.

- [`./Noiseless simulations/`](./Noiseless%20simulations/)  
  Includes all simulation data generated using **Qiskit Aer** and **Matrix Product State (MPS)** methods. These files correspond to the noiseless numerical results analyzed in the manuscript.

- [`./Hardware data/`](./Hardware%20data/)  
  Provides hardware calibration information and all experimental data collected from the quantum processor used in the study.
