#Superdiffusion Resilience in Heisenberg Chains with 2D Interactions on a Quantum Processor — Data Repository\\

This repository contains the datasets and accompanying scripts used in the manuscript “Superdiffusion Resilience in Heisenberg Chains with 2D Interactions on a Quantum Processor.”\\

Repository Structure
Scripts/
This directory contains the Python scripts used to initialize and construct the quantum circuits employed in both classical and quantum simulations presented in the manuscript.\\

Noiseless_Simulation/
This directory includes all simulation data generated using Qiskit Aer and Matrix Product State (MPS) methods. These datasets correspond to the noiseless numerical results presented throughout the paper.\\

Hardware_Data/
This directory provides hardware calibration records and all experimental data collected from the quantum processor. These files include the device specifications and measurement results presented in the paper.\\
